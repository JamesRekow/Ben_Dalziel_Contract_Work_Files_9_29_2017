Amazon AMI Notes

Using default setup

##  set up AMI in AWS  ##
jamesrekow@gmail.com
classic pw

##  connect to AMI  ##
open git bash on desktop
first position is location of ssh key on laptop, second position uses the ip address of the AMI given to me by AWS
ssh -i ~/.ssh/MyKeyPair.pem ec2-user@34.212.120.183

##  create piusBenchmark directory in AMI  ##

##  send files from laptop to AMI  ##
open a second git bash on desktop
copy a file from laptop to AMI, from git bash in home directory (on desktop) (need to change the ip address,
which you get from AWS, and which is not always the same as the ip address given in the bash command prompt of the AMI):
1st file is ssh key pair, second file is file to copy, third file is the address of AMI and the location
in which to place the file copy
scp -i ~/.ssh/MyKeyPair.pem ~/Desktop/Documents/Contract_Work/Ben_Dalziel/Universality_GLV_Model_3/* ec2-user@ec2-34-213-11-138.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/piusBenchmark/


##  install R on AMI  ##
sudo yum install -y R

##  perform tasks in R ##
R #  to enter R
install necessary packages
install.packages(c("igraph", "gtools", "snow", "parallel")) #  this can take 5 minutes or so
say yes twice
choose CRAN mirror 53 (CA) unless that one fails to work
source("piusBenchmark_AMI_Ver.r")
piusBenchmark = piusBenchmark_AMI_Ver(numReplicates = 2, numComputeClusters = 32) #  example of runnning function
write.csv(piusBenchmark, "piusBenchmark.csv", row.names = FALSE) #  save output as csv
quit() #  when in R to exit

##  send csv file back from AMI to laptop  ##
this is also done in GIT BASH from laptop desktop (not in the AMI command line)
write a file from AMI to laptop (same idea, just put AMI address and file location in second position after ssh key, and
put file location in laptop in the 3rd position)
scp -i ~/.ssh/MyKeyPair.pem ec2-user@ec2-34-213-11-138.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/piusBenchmark/piusBenchmark.csv ~/Desktop/Documents/Contract_Work/Ben_Dalziel/Universality_GLV_Model_3/AWS_PIUS_Benchmark_Results
