## Introduction ##  
  
The software contained with this README simulates generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) models describing  
bacterial populations inside host organisms following the methodology described in "Universality of  
human microbial dynamics" by Amir Bashan, Travis E. Gibson, Jonathan Friedman, Vincent J. Carey, Scott  
T. Weiss, Elizabeth L. Hohmann & Yang-Yu Liu. There are two differences between their software in Matlab  
and the R code contained here. First, the criterion for determining if a sample is at a steady state was  
based on having a sufficiently small ratio deltax / x in their model, and is based on having a sufficient  
number of consecutive sufficiently small delta x values in this model. Second, this model contains a framework  
for modeling interactions between samples in a single cohort that builds on their work but is an independent  
creation. This work is primarily in the function intraCohortInteraction.r.  
  
## Data Structures ##  
  
sample: A list with three elements: abundance (abd), growth rate (gr), and interaction matrix (imat).  
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a sample with N bacterial species (for example a dog with 10 species of bacteria in its nose)  
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abd and gr are each numerical vectors of length N, while imat is a numerical N x N matrix.  
  
	abd - gr - imat  
  
cohort: A list of samples.  
  
	abd - gr - imat

	abd - gr - imat

	abd - gr - imat   
          |  
          |
  	     ...  
  
doc: A list frame containing the overlap and dissimilarity values of of each pair of samples from a cohort.  
     The first vector is the overlap values, the second vector is the dissimilarity values. To take advantage  
     of R's plotting internals the overlap and dissimilarity vectors are named "x" and "y" respectively.  
  
## Common Variables ##  
  
Note: This section gives a description of the most common variables found in the functions packaged with this  
      README. Variables described here are not listed in the ARGS section of functions in which they appear.  
      Instead, they are referred to as the "usual suspects".  
  
M             - number of samples in a cohort  
N             - number of bacterial species in a sample  
iStrength     - interaction strength. A measure of the interaction strength between bacterial species in a sample,  
                in the range [0, 1]. Assumed equal for each sample in a given cohort  
univ          - universality, in the range [0, 1]. A measure of how similar the interactions between bacterial species  
                within a sample are between different samples in the same cohort. If univ = 1 then all samples have  
                identical interaction matrices describing the inter-species interactions of bacteria within the sample  
                and all samples have identical growth rates  
sigmaMax      - parameter controlling the spread of values in the interaction matrices describing inter-bacterial  
                interactions within a sample  
thresholdMult - controls the sensitivity of the integration step. Lowering this makes the integration  
                more accurate  
maxSteps      - the maximum number of integration steps allowed by the eulerIntegrate function before terminating  
tStep         - time step. Delta t in the integration performed by eulerIntegrate  
intTime       - total time during the interaction step. Unrelated to tStep  
interSmplMult - the fraction of a sample's abundances that get transmitted upon contact with another sample   
                (transmission is bi-directional and does not deplete the abundances of the sample from which it  
                is transmitted)  
lambda        - rate parameter for the exponentially distributed wait times between interactions  
conGraph      - connectivity graph. Vertices represent samples and edges connect samples that can interact. This  
                is an igraph object  
  
## Standard Names of Intermediate Variables ##  
  
smpl     - sample  
chrt     - cohort  
abd      - abundance  
gr       - growth rate  
imat     - interaction matrix  
abdList  - list of abundance vectors for each sample in a cohort  
grList   - list of growth rate vectors for each sample in a cohort  
imatList - list of interaction matrices for each sample in a cohort  
conGraph - connectivity graph  
doc/DOC  - doc object, as described above  
DOCDF    - data frame doc instead of a list  
DOCNS    - doc that only contains points in the negative slope (NS) region of the overlap-dissimilarity (OD) plane. That  
           is, points with overlap greater than or equal to the largest overlap such that the DOC curve has a negative   
           slope for all overlap values greater than or equal to that one
