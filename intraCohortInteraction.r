  #         interSmplMult - the fraction of a sample's abundances that get transmitted
  #                         upon contact with another sample (transmission is bi-directional
  #                         and does not deplete the abundance of the dog from which it is 
  #                         transmitted)

  #                    supplied, then samples can interact if and only if their corresponding
  #                    vertices are connected by an edge

  #        than intTime but the next wait time makes cumTime greater than intTime then the interaction
  #        corresponding to that wait time does not occur.
